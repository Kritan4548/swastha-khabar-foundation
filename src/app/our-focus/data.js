    title: "Establishing health as a prominent political agenda",
    content:
      "Despite the rhetoric, public health has not featured prominently in Nepal’s political agenda. Competing priorities where results are evident in a short span of time, such as infrastructure projects, get the most political traction. Politicians often lack platforms to learn about the complexities of health and are often fed jargon-laden information and evidence that is difficult to comprehend. Our work changes this equation by translating complex health data and information into more accessible and readable formats and by working with politicians to identify opportunities and investment areas in health that garner political capital for them.",

    title: "Linking citizens to Nepal's health system",
    content:
      "We recognise the vital role of a connected and informed citizenry in shaping Nepal’s health system. Unfortunately, Nepal’s health systems lack adequate mechanisms for citizens to engage or provide feedback, and more often, health policies and agendas are set without considering the nuanced needs and contexts of the local communities. As a result, even in areas where Nepal’s health sector has made progress, equity gaps persist. However, in federal Nepal, opportunities exist, particularly at the subnational levels, to enable citizens to participate in setting health agendas and demand accountability. We exploit these opportunities to put people at the centre of health discourse.",

    title: "Leveraging the Nepali Diaspora",
    content:
      "The Nepali diaspora holds a wealth of international knowledge and experience. To harness their collective knowledge and experience for the purpose of strengthening Nepal’s health systems, they have actively supported the country through humanitarian efforts and quick-win projects in health. Moving beyond philanthropy and aiming for sustained efforts, we provide a credible platform for them to connect and collaborate with Nepal’s policymakers, experts, and civic leaders. This collaborative approach seeks to make a long-lasting impact on the health of the Nepali population.",

    title: "Organising high-profile health events",
    content:
      "Many health sector events tend to be ‘technical’ or esoteric in nature, assembling usual actors and experts, which are not always conducive to finding broader solutions to health issues. By high-profile events we mean, events encompassing multi-disciplinary audiences that connect practitioners to planners and policymakers and bring actors from different sectors for a collective health discourse. We always involve relevant political actors in these events, which not only aids in discussing or seeking high-level political solutions to problems but also allows politicians to understand the prevalent health issues better. For the last two years, we have expanded the scope of our Health Award events to include topical public health discussions.",

    title: "Recognising and motivating Nepal’s health workers",
    content:
      "We have been acknowledging and celebrating the unwavering dedication of Nepal's health workers. Our Health Awards initiative aims to recognise their exceptional contributions, providing a platform to showcase their achievements and motivate them to continue their outstanding service. Our parent organisation, Swasthya Khabar, has been a big advocate for creating an environment that enables health workers to perform their duties comfortably and safely. Our work continues these efforts by supporting the government, health councils, and associations to enact necessary legislation and policies, working with local government on the welfare of health workers, particularly those serving the remote communities of Nepal.",

    title: "Developing A Platform For Health Policy Dialogue",
    content: `This area is pivotal to our organisational commitment. This initiative centers on creating a
      dynamic space for open discussions among diverse stakeholders in the healthcare domain.
      Through these discussions, we facilitate knowledge exchange; ensuring decisions are grounded
      in the latest evidence and expertise. Our strategy involves ongoing dialogue, research uptake and active
      engagement with policymakers to influence decision-making processes. The intended impact is
      to contribute to informed decision-making, anticipate future healthcare needs, and empower
      communities to shape policies. Ultimately, our goal is to foster a healthcare system that is
      adaptive, effective, and prioritizes the well-being of the communities.`,
