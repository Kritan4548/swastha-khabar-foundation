      "The potential of digital health in Nepal is significant to bridge the gaps across the health system components. Digital technologies can significantly facilitate the delivery of personalised and longitudinal care; they can aid in efficiently managing public health inputs and resources, drive data and evidence-driven policies and plans, and accentuate health accountability endeavours by linking people with the health systems. ",
      "Nepal's evolving digital health ecosystem reflects a blend of donor-supported but government-led initiatives, non-governmental projects, and private-sector investments, all aimed at leveraging the latest digital technologies to improve the health and well-being of the citizens. However, their designs and deployments are not always thought through holistically, resulting in isolated implementation of technologies. ",
      "Digital solutions are often considered 'add-ons' rather than central components that can deliver on the state's promise of health to the people by connecting health system components, amplifying people’s voices and participation, enhancing health service delivery, and efficiently managing public health resources",
      "Furthermore, the fragile regulatory environment prevents the effective adoption of technologies.",
